[Trijam](https://itch.io/jam/trijam-173) is a weekly game jam where the goal is to create a game in under 3 hours of development time. Monster Mimic was completed in about 8 hours of active development time.

## Synopsis

Monster Mimic is a speed and memory game. Players assume the role of a monster with the ability to mimic the appearance of monsters they encounter. 

The objective of the game is to accurately match the appearance of another monster within the finite amount of time.
